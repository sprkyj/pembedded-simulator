-Embedded System using Python (Simon-Says simulator)

-Needed: https://create.withcode.uk/ (embedded system simulator)

Nothing special, but this is a simple embedded python game.
You do not need a physical embedded system. There is a provided link to access an embedded system simulator.
You can play a very simple version of simon-says. 

(Simon will ask to move left,right, or stay still.)
